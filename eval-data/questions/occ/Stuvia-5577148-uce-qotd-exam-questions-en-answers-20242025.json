        "question": "Duration measures how long it takes, in years, for an investor to be repaid the bond's price by the bond's total cash flows. At the same time, duration is a measure of sensitivity of a bond's or fixed income portfolio's price to changes in interest rates. In general, the higher the duration, the more a bond's price will drop as interest rates rise (and the greater the interest rate risk). As a general rule, for every 1% change in interest rates (increase or decrease), a bond's price will change approximately 1% in the opposite direction, for every year of duration. If a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates increase 1%, the bond's price will drop by approximately 5% (1% X 5 years). Likewise, if interest rates fall by 1%, the same bond's price will increase by about 5% (1% X 5 years).
