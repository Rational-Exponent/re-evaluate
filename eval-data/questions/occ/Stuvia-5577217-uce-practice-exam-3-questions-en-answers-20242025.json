        "truth": "Answer - B. The types of CPA opinions are discussed in the CHNBE Section 102.1. An unqualified opinion contains no modifying language regarding the scope or description of the auditor's work. An adverse opinion indicates the auditor has taken strong exception to some matter such that the financial statements do not fairly represent the financial position or do not conform to GAAP. A qualified opinion reflects the existence of some type of exception to GAAP necessary for an unqualified opinion but not so great as to result in an adverse opinion. A disclaimer of opinion will result if the scope of the audit was materially restricted for some reason or when the financial statements are affected by uncertainties. In such circumstances the CPA will deny any professional responsibility for the quality of the financial statements.",
